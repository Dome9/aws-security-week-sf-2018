## Level 3

In this level you'll be protecting against exposed S3 buckets.<br/>

Overly permissive bucket ACLs or bucket policies should only be used for content that should be exposed to the world. By default, everything should avoid allow-all type permissions

### Your challenge
Do not allow exposed S3 buckets to be created

### Tips
- Review the valid / nonvalid samples for insights regarding structure
- Check both the bucket policy and ACLs



Good luck
