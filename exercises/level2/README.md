## Level 2

In this level you'll be enforcing a tagging policy.<br/>

Tags help an environment keep track of resource allocation, cost, owner, and many other things. 

### Your challenge
Do not allow resources to be created without a key of "owner"

### Tips
- Review the valid / nonvalid samples for insights regarding structure




Good luck
